# Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr-Interstitials

This repository contains scripts related to the manuscript "Revealing interstitial energetics in Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy via universal machine learning interatomic potentials"
All-in-one bash script ./SQS-ATAT/.SQS_Ti-23Nb-0_7Ta-2Zr.sh creates special quasirandom structures (SQSs) with 250-atom supercell approximating the composiiton of Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr. 
Folder ./uMLIPs-GOScripts for the generation of SQS for Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum-metal base alloy and to perform structure optimizations with N, C, O, H interstitials
